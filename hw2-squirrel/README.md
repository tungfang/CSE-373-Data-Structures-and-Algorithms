# Part 1a: Implement DoubleLinkedList
## Task: complete the DoubleLinkedList class.
A doubly-linked list is a similar to the singly-linked lists you studied in CSE 143 except in two crucial ways: your nodes now have pointers to both the previous and next nodes, and your linked list class has now have pointers to both the front and back of your sequence of list node objects.
