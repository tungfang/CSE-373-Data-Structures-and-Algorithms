# CSE 373 HW3:Testing, ChainedHashDictionary, and ChainedHashSet
## Overview
In this homework, you will implement a hash dictionary (also known as a hash map) and a hash set. We will be using these two data structures extensively in the next project.
You will use these files from your prior assignments

- main.java.datastructures.concrete.dictionaries.ArrayDictionary.java
- main.java.datastructures.concrete.DoubleLinkedList.java

If you have chosen a new partner for this assignment, choose either of your submissions from HW2 and verify that these are functioning properly.

You will be modifying the following files:

- main.java.datastructures.concrete.dictionaries.ArrayDictionary.java
- main.java.datastructures.concrete.ChainedHashSet.java
- main.java.datastructures.concrete.dictionaries.ChainedHashDictionary.java
Additionally, here are a few more files that you might want to review while completing the assignment (note that this is just a starting point, not necessarily an exhaustive list):

- test.java.datastructures.TestChainedHashSet.java
- test.java.datastructures.dictionaries.TestChainedHashDictionary
- test.java.datastructures.dictionaries.TestArrayDictionary.java
- main.java.datastructures.interfaces.IDictionary.java
- main.java.datastructures.interfaces.ISet.java
